[Edit](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/18115).

- Added [minorTicksPerMajor](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.minorTicksPerMajor) option for axes, see [#13338](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/13338). [Edit](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/18540).

- Added new series type, treegraph. [Read more in the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treegraph-chart). [Edit](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/17600).

## Upgrade notes
- The top-level `labels` option has been deprecated for a long time and is now removed. Use [Annotations](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/annotations-module) instead.
- Time-related settings on the [global](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/global) options structure are removed. Use the [time](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/time) options instead.
- If you're using [chart.styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode), and your end users have [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) set to `dark` in their browsers, they may now be presented with dark-themed charts. The exception is if your CSS overrides the default coloring.
- The default builds were changed to ECMAScript version ES2016. See the [system requirements](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/system-requirements) on how to support IE11 and other legacy browsers.
- Changed default [rotationMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sunburst.dataLabels.rotationMode) to `circular` for sunburst data labels.
