# Changelog for Highcharts v10.0.0 (2022-03-07)

- Added new options: [hangingIndentTranslation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.organization.hangingIndentTranslation) and [minNodeLength](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.organization.minNodeLength) for Organization chart, for improving the layout of deep structures. See [#13915](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/13915).

## Upgrade notes
- In an organization chart, children of a parent with `hanging` layout will now inherit this layout. To prevent this, set `layout = "normal"` for these nodes.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#16788](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/16788), accessibility issue with some columns not being focusable because of wrong `point.isInside` flag.
- Fixed [#16979](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/16979), only one point per x value was shown when [stacking](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.stacking) set to `percent`.
- Fixed [#16974](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/16974), esc keypress keyboard focus issue with multiple charts on the same page.
- Fixed [#14175](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/14175), enabling and disabling [dataLabels.rotation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.dataLabels.rotation) misplaced data label's position.
