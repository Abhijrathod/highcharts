# Changelog for Highcharts Maps v10.2.1 (2022-10-28)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 10.2.1 above also apply to Highcharts Maps 10.2.1.
- Improved the UX on legend items when using a color axis with data classes. Hovering now renders other map areas as inactive, and clicking the legend item renders them as `null` rather than completely hiding them. [Edit](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/17683).
