Click the "play" button and observe:
- A voice should be counting from 1 to 8 with varying voice pitch.
- Notes from two different instruments should play, both in between and at the same time as the voice.
- Button text should revert to "Play" when everything is done playing.

Click the "play last notes" button and observe:
- Only the notes from "6" and up are played.

Also try pausing and resuming the playback for both buttons.

(NB: Both buttons control the same timeline, so bugs happen if you pause one button and play the other, this is fine.)
