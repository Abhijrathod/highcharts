Click the "play" button and observe:
- The series should play as sound from left to right.
- The tooltip and crosshair should follow the points while playing.
- There should be a constant repeating note indicating the pitch of the y-axis plot line.
- When playing notes inside the x-axis plot band, an additional percussive repeating sound should play.
