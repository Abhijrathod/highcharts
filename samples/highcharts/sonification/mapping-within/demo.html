        By default, pitch is mapped within each Y-axis. In this chart, the first series is assigned to the left Y-axis, while the second and third series are assigned to the right Y-axis. With pitch mapped within Y-axis, the first series will get its own pitch mapping, while Series 2 and Series 3 will be mapped together. If the pitch range goes from the notes C2 to C5, Series 1 will be mapped with its lowest value to C2, and its highest to C5. For the other series, C2 will be mapped to whichever value is lowest among Series 2 and Series 3, and C5 will be mapped to whichever value is highest within both series.
