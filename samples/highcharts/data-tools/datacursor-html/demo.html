    DataCursor is used in this demo to synchronize the mouse focus in two
    DataTable and their corresponding HTML tables. It adds and removes the
    'Focus' class on HTML table cells and rows, so that different shades of blue
    appear.
    <br /><br />
    This feature is also useful when you need to compare multiple tables side by
    side and easily see which cell corresponds to the same value across all
    tables.
